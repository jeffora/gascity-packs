# Compound Engineering Pack

This pack implements the Gas City `build-base` workflow contract with vendored
[Compound Engineering Plugin](https://github.com/EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin)
skills.

## What It Provides

- Formula: `compound-build`
- Expansion formulas: `compound-plan-review`, `compound-code-review`,
  `compound-resolution`
- Implementation item formulas: `compound-work`, `compound-work-item`
- Vendored skills: `ce-brainstorm`, `ce-plan`, `ce-work`, `ce-code-review`,
  and `ce-compound`
- Vendored agent personas under `vendor/compound-engineering-plugin/agents/`
- Provenance: `vendor/compound-engineering-plugin/upstream.toml`

Upstream Compound Engineering skills use persona subagents. This pack converts
those fanouts into Gas City item formulas and expansion formulas with explicit
`gc.*` lanes. The vendored agent files are prompt inputs only; the workflow must
not invoke provider-native subagents, slash commands, task tools, or the
upstream plugin runtime. `ce-work` is an override of the inherited `do-work`
implementation step; `ce-compound` is used during the `finalize` stage through
`compound-resolution`; the base workflow does not add a separate compound
stage.

## End-to-End Flow

The Compound Engineering pack keeps the stock brainstorm, plan, persona-review,
work, code-review, and compounding phases, but maps native subagent fanout onto
Gas City graph lanes, convoys, and drained item formulas.

Blue nodes are inherited Gas City behavior, green nodes are Compound
Engineering-specific overrides, and amber nodes are Gas City graph, convoy, or
drain infrastructure. The plan-review and code-review stages are explicit graph
loops: required findings route back through the same fanout/fix stage instead
of falling through to decomposition or finalization. Implementation keeps the
Gas City drain lifecycle, so independent convoy members can run in parallel
while each member receives a Compound `ce-work` item formula.

The post-implementation code-review lanes are real fan-out/fan-in graph work.
The reviewer beads are siblings unless a lane has its own cheap selector gate;
the synthesis bead is the fan-in barrier that waits for all required reviewer
artifacts.

## Import It

Import this pack at city scope. It imports the Gas City pack internally as
`gc`, so `build-base` is available transitively:

```toml
[imports.compound-engineering]
source = "../gascity-packs/compound-engineering"
```

Then launch `compound-build` from the target rig context. Rig role agents still
use the Gas City `gc.*` override surface.
